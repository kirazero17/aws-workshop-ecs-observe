# Resource monitoring on Amazon ECS

### Amazon ECS

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. It's integrated with both AWS tools, such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry, and third-party tools, such as Docker. This integration makes it easier for teams to focus on building the applications, not the environment. You can run and scale your container workloads across AWS Regions in the cloud, and on-premises, without the complexity of managing a control plane.

### Monitoring your ECS resources

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon ECS and your AWS solutions. You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multi-point failure if one occurs. In this workshop, you are about to learn how to monitor your ECS resources using CloudWatch, Container Insight and Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.
